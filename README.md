# CIFAR10-Image-Classification
## Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation

### Install

This project requires **Python 3** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Tensorflow](http://tensorflow.org/)


You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 


### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory  (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook dlnd_image_classification.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook dlnd_image_classification.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## About

In this project, we will classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. You'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. At the end, we will see the CNN's predictions on the sample images.
